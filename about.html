        <p>ZENA (Zero-touch ENhanced Assistant) is an AI-powered gesture recognition system designed to make
            human-computer
            interaction more natural and intuitive. It allows users to control their computer through simple hand
            gestures
            without touching a keyboard or mouse. Using MediaPipe Hands and JavaScript, ZENA detects movements like
            zooming,
            scrolling, or opening websites in real time. Its goal is to enhance accessibility and create a touchless
            interface that feels futuristic yet practical. ZENA also provides voice feedback for every action, making
            the
            experience more interactive. Built as an academic innovation project, it showcases the power of computer
            vision
            in daily computing. The system promotes contact-free control, which is especially useful in
            hygiene-sensitive or
            hands-free environments. ZENA combines modern web technologies with AI precision to deliver a seamless user
            experience.</p>
